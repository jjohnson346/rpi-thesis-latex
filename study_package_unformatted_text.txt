Analyzing Documents
When a fraud examiner is conducting an examination and is in the process of collecting documents, he should:
C A. Try to handle the original as little as possible C B. Maintain a good filing system for the documents C C. Take the original document if it is available
3 of 16
C D All of the above
When collecting documents during the course of an examination, the examiner should: (1) obtain the original document where feasible, make working copies, and keep the originals segregated; (2) not touch originals any more than necessary as they might later have to undergo forensic analysis; and (3) maintain a good filing system for the documents. This is especially critical where large volumes of documents are obtained.

Which of the following methods can be used to obtain documentary evidence?
C A. Oral consent C B. Written consent C C. Subpoena
4 of 16
C D All of the above
If both parties agree, it is possible to obtain evidence by consent This is the preferred method. The consent can be oral or written. When information is obtained from possible adverse witnesses, or the target of the examination, it is recommended that the consent be in writing. In many cases, however, the investigator will not wish to alert the suspect to his intentions and other routes must be taken. If the evidence is owned by and in the control of the party that requests the investigation (for instance, in desk drawers in the office), then the investigator is usually able to obtain the documents as required. If evidence is held by other parties or in uncontrolled locations, specific legal action is required before attempting to obtain it. This usually takes the form of a subpoena or other order from the court to produce the documents and records (including electronic records). Other forms of court orders can be used to obtain witness evidence and statements. Under no circumstances should the investigator attempt to obtain documents by other means, as this can lead to charges of theft, trespass, and other sanctions.

From the moment evidence is received, it is necessary to preserve the chain of custody. This can be done effectively through the use of a memorandum. Such a memorandum should, at a minimum, contain all of the following EXCEPT:
C A. What items were received
C B. From whom the items were received
C C The name of the judge who issued the warrant
x INCORRECT
C D. When the items were received
From the moment evidence is received, its "chain of custody" must be maintained for it to be accepted by the court. This means that a record must be made when the item is received or when it leaves the care, custody, or control of the fraud examiner This is best handled by a memorandum of interview with the custodian of the records when the evidence is received. The memorandum should state: (1) what items were received, (2) when they were received, (3) from whom they were received, and (4) where they are maintained.

Jones, a Certified Fraud Examiner and Director of Security for ABC Inc., obtained several boxes of documents while conducting a fraud examination. While inventorying the boxes and marking the evidence, Jones discovers a stock certificate he feels will be damaged if he marks it with his initials and the date. In order to maintain the proper chain of custody, Jones should:
C A. Mark the certificate regardless of the potential for damage
C B. Place it in an envelope and mark the envelope
C C Copy the document and initial and date the copy
X INCORRECT
C D. Photograph the document
All evidence received should be marked so that it can later be identified. The most common way to mark the evidence is with the date and initials of the person obtaining the documents. If it is not practical to mark the document or if marking it would damage the document, then it should be placed in an envelope and the envelope should be marked and sealed.

indented writing on a pad of paper should be developed by shading with a pencil.
A. True
13 of 16
C B. False
Never attempt to develop indented writings by shading or scratching on the surface of a sheet of paper with a pencil. This will reveal deep indentations, but it will not reveal the faint ones and will permanently prevent expert examinations from developing them. Other types of technical examinations might also be prevented by this defacing of the document.

Analyzing Documents
The art of forensic document identification is called "graphology."
15 of 16
C A. True
C B. False
X INCORRECT
V CORRECT
Graphology (graphoanalysis) has been described as a pseudoscience in which its practitioners have the purported ability to determine a person’s character moral traits (honesty/dishonesty, etc.), personality, and mental state based upon an analysis of that person's handwriting. Graphology is often erroneously confused with forensic document examinations, especially by the media. Fraud examiners should be aware that some of those practicing graphological analyses might have little academic scientific training.

Analyzing Documents
When dealing with documents and other forms of evidence, it is necessary to preserve the
16 of 16
in order for it to be accepted by a court.
C A. Chain of custody
C B. Evidential value C C. Exhibit stamp C D. None of the above
From the moment evidence is received, its chain of custody must be maintained for it to be accepted by the court. This means that a record must be made when the item is received or when it leaves the care, custody, or control of the fraud examiner. This is best handled by a memorandum of interview with the custodian of the records when the evidence is received.
