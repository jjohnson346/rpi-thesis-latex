	Abstract = {Predicting and explaining the behavior of others in terms
        of mental states is indispensable for everyday life. It will
        be equally important for artificial agents. We present an
        inference system for representing and reasoning about mental
        states, and use it to provide a formal analysis of the
        false-belief task. The system allows for the representation of
        information about events, causation, and perceptual, doxastic,
        and epistemic states (vision, belief, and knowledge),
        incorporating ideas from the event calculus and multi-agent
        epistemic logic. Unlike previous AI formalisms, our focus here
        is on mechanized proofs and proof programmability, not on
        metamathematical results. Reasoning is performed via
        cognitively plausible inference rules, and automation is
        achieved by general-purpose inference methods, akin to the
        demons of blackboard-based multi-agent systems. The system has
        been implemented and is available for experimentation.},

            procedure that finds proofs for Godel's incompleteness
            theorems at an abstract axiomatic level.  As axioms we
            take for granted the representability and derivability
            conditions for the central syntactic notions as well as
            the diagonal lemma for constructing self-referential
            sentences.  The strategies are logical ones and have been
            developed to search for natural deduction proofs in classical
            first-order logic.  The heuristics are mostly of a very general
            mathematical character and are concerned with the goal-directed
            use of definitions and lemmas.  When they are specific to the
            meta-mathematical context, these heuristics allow us, e.g.,
            to move between the object- and meta-theory.  Instead of
            viewing this work as high-level proof search, it can be
            regarded as a first step in a proof-planning framework: the
            next refining steps would consist in verifying the axiomatically
            given conditions.  Comparisons with the literature are detailed
            in Section 4.  (The general mathematical heuristics are indeed
            general:  in Appendix B we show that they, together with two
            simple algebraic facts and the logical strategies, suffice to
            find a proof of) }},

@article{what.ia.takes,
	Author = {David Moore and Lisa Krizan},
	Comment = {{Reasoning: The ability to reason is what permits humans to process information and formulate explanations, to assign meaning to observed phenomena. It is by reasoning that analysts transform information into intelligence, in these three ways: 1. Induction: Inductive reasoning combines separate pieces of information, or specific answers to problems, to form general rules or conclusions. For example, using induction, a child learns to associate the color red with heat and heat with pain, and then to generalize these associations to new situations. Rigorous induction depends upon demonstrating the validity of causal relationships between observed phenomena, not merely associating them with each other. 2. Deduction: Deductive reasoning applies general rules to specific problems to arrive at conclusions. Analysts begin with a set of rules and use them as a basis for interpreting information. For example, an analyst researching the nuclear weapons program of a country might notice that a characteristic series of events preceded the last nuclear weapons test. Upon seeing evidence that those same events are occurring again, the analyst might deduce that a second nuclear test is imminent. However, this conclusion would be made cautiously, since deduction works best in closed systems such as mathematics, making it of limited use in forecasting human behavior. 3. Abduction: Abductive reasoning describe the thought process that accompanies ``insight" or intuition. When the information does not match the expected, the analyst asks ``why?," thereby generating novel hypotheses to explain given evidence that does not readily suggest a familiar explanation. For example, given two shipping manifest, one showing oranges and lemons being shipped from Venezuela to Florida, and the other showing carnations being shipped from Delaware to Columbia, abductive reaoning is what enables the analyst to take an analytic leap and ask, ``Why is citrus fruit being sent to the worldwide capital of citrus farming, while carnations are being sent to the world's primary exporter of that product? What is really going on here?}},

@inproceedings{respiration_ilp,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the analysis of respiration during
             musical performance by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP).  
             For effective musical performance, it is one of the most 
             important factors to control one's respiration in response
             to the aspects of the music performed.  It is, however, often
             difficult even for experts to explain how to do do clearly.
             We measured respiration during cello performance by using a
             respiration sensor, and tried to extract rules of respiration
             from the data together with musical/performance background
             knowledge such as harmonic progression and bowing direction.
             As a result it was found that there was repeatability and
             regularity in performers' respiration pattern during musical
             performance, and then consistency in respiration with regard
             to musical structure was confirmed.  It was also discovered
             that players tend to exhale at the beginning of new large
             musical structures, and inhale immediately before the change
             of keys.},

              of retrieving precise answers to natural language (NL)
              questions, was introduced in late 1960-ies and early
              1970-ies within the framework of Artificial
              Intelligence. The advent of WWW and the need to provide
              advanced, user-friendly search tools has extended the QA
              paradigm to a larger audience of people and a larger
              number of fields, including medicine.  This paper
              reviews three research approaches utilized in automated
              QA in medical domains and discusses their application
              areas},
