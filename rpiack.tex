\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Selmer Bringsjord, for his continual support and encouragement during my doctoral studies -- Thank you, Selmer!  I'd also like to thank the members of my dissertation committee -- Dr. Micah Clark, Prof. Eugene Eberbach, Prof. Sergei Nirenburg, Prof. Mei Sei, and Prof. Boleslaw Szymanski -- for their guidance over the course of completing my dissertation.  I'd also like to thank the staff of the RPI Computer Science and Cognitive Science departments -- Paula Monihan, Terry Hayden, and Sibel Adali -- for their support in navigating the twists and turns of the administrative process of the Ph.D. program.  I'd also like to give a special thanks to Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu, who as a colleague during my graduate work, provided sage advice, insight, and wisdom during this long journey.  

Most importantly, I'd like to extend my greatest thanks to my wife, Courtney, and my daughters, Kayla and Avery, without whose unquestioning support and patience this endeavor would not have been possible.
