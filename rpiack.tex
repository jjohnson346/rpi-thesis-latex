\specialhead{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

I'd like to thank my thesis advisor, Prof. Selmer Bringsjord, for his continual support and encouragement during the pursuit of my Ph.D.  I'd also like to thank the members of my dissertation committee -- Dr. Micah Clark, Prof. Eugene Eberbach, Prof. Sergei Nirenburg, Prof. Mei Sei, and Prof. Boleslaw Szymanski -- for their guidance over the course of completing my dissertation.  I'd also like to give a special thanks to Naveen Sundar Govindarajulu, who as a colleague during my graduate work, provided sage advice, insight, and wisdom during this long journey.

Finally, I'd like to extend my greatest thanks to my family -- my wife, Courtney, and my daughters, Kayla and Avery -- without whose unquestioning support this would not have been possible.
